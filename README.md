# 12. Creating tables with Jinja macros

We will need a lot of flexibility in creating tables.  Let's write a macro for that.

```bash
a@SNAVVV:~/code/FastAPI-Slowly$ git checkout -b 12
Switched to a new branch '12'

a@SNAVVV:~/code/FastAPI-Slowly$ touch static/templates/macros.html.jinja

a@SNAVVV:~/code/FastAPI-Slowly$ poetry version minor
Bumping version from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0
```
